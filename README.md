# ZateynikiChrono
My very old project for my friends
An application for children's games for a while, where the participants start in pairs and their time is clocked.
Procedure:
1. Enter the participant numbers in the required fields.
2. Announce start and press "Start" button.
3. Fix the finish by pressing the necessary buttons.
4. View results and summarize.
